	/*
	 * A stream is a sequence of elements from a source that supports data processing operations
	 * (data structures are about storing items and streams are about computation)
	 * 
	 * streams support database-like operations and common operations from functional programming languages
	 * (filter, map, reduce etc.)
	 * 
	 * streams operations can be executed either sequentially or in parallel
	 * 
	 * we can define intermediate operations that return a stream as well - allowing multiple operations to be
	 * chained(these are similiar to db queries)
	 * 
	 * This is called pipelining
	 * 
	 * collections are iterated explicitly with iterators (external iteration) but we can use a different approach
	 * with streams
	 * 
	 * This is called Internal Iteration
